## Possible pitfalls: 

### 1. It's in the algorithm / It's an engineering problem

The problem you see -- perhaps one of crushing bureaucratic incompetence or disorganized citizens -- probably can't be fixed with a website.

### 2. It is possible to be too niche

You may have very accurately defined your target audience and identified their headache. However, the market / user base may be too small to sustain you. 

From ReportingOn's [farewell blogpost](http://ec2-23-21-180-28.compute-1.amazonaws.com/idealab/2010/12/lessons-learned-from-reportingon363) about building highly specialized tools for journalists (and applicable to just about any domain, like civic tech):

> Unless what you're building meets a very journalism-specific need, you're probably grinding your gears to build something "for journalists" when they just need a great communication tool, independent of any particular niche or category of users.
