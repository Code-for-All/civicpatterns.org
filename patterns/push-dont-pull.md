Send your users information directly, without them having to come to your site to get it.

If you have a search page, let the user sign up for regular emails for their search. This
helps the user by saving them from having to remember to visit your site regularly. It also
helps your site build engagement by reminding your users about what you can offer them.

If you're regularly updating your site with new content, send them an email about it.

Always let users unsubscribe from emails if they no longer want to receive them.
