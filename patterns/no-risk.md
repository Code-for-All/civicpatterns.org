Design your project to collect only the data points necessary for implementation of your project; know what you will be using each data point for when you are designing the project, and avoid the 'more data the better' attitude, for the safety of those you are working with. 

There are some datasets (eg. certain health information, like HIV status, or ethnicity) for which collection should be strictly avoided, unless absolutely necessary. (Think about the potential unintended consequences of these data sets getting in the hands of malicious actors.)
