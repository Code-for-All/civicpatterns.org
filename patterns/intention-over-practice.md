You might be tempted to build something that people _want_ to do (or feel like they _should_ do), but ultimately don't.

 * Examples: The post-conference social network that seems like a great idea _at_ the conference, but subsequently goes unused. The Project/Task Management tool that people would rather agonize over rather than actually doing the project or the task itself
