Your homepage probably isn't the core reason that people will visit your site.
Work on the pages that really deliver value first. You can often put these
pages in front of a test audience without worrying about a homepage. You can
also share direct links to these pages.

Most of your users will spend only a short amount of time on your homepage.
It's critical to bringing in new users and helping them understand how your product
works. But it's even more important the the key functionality is in place first.

You can start helping people without a homepage. But you can't help people with
just a homepage.
