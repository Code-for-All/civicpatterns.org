Design your app to be officially adopted or replace an existing resource. You may need to invest more time in social processes (explaining, building trust, gaining buy-in) than engineering; or engineering may need to be focused on maintenance/infrastructure constraints or accessibility ([508 compliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973)in the US!) over raw functionality.

## Possible pitfalls: Resourcing

Governments are usually reasonably well resourced and can afford to run services that would stretch smaller entities. That said, sometimes externals can produce the same or better results more quickly and efficiently by doing it totally differently. 

Pick your battles carefully and make sure you have considered whether you have sufficient resource (and attention-span) to apply energy to get your tool adopted if you are attempting this strategy.
