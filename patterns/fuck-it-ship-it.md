The sooner you put your product in front of users, the sooner you'll get
valuable feedback. Build the [minimum viable product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) that makes
sense and release it as soon as you can. It doesn't need to be perfect, and it
doesn't need to be complete.

In all likelihood at least some of your assumptions about your product are
wrong. The best way to find out which ones is to test them on real users.
It's far cheaper to discover them sooner, when you can correct them
cheaply, than to discover them later after wasting a lot of time and
money.
