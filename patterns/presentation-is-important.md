## Common pitfalls 

### 1. The data dump

If it doesn't and it is genuinely a-political - reconsider whether you are saying anything interesting. 

If you are targeting your website at researchers or experts, perhaps they will be interested in the entire data dump, but visualisations usually pick out and highlight key aspects of the data to make particular points and that involves editorial judgement. 

### 2. Focussing on the negative vs challenging assumptions

Crime maps, restaurant inspections, waste/fraud/abuse. While these may be useful applications, they are overrepresented in civic technology. Also, these applications often do little to challenge people's preconcieved notions, let alone educate them on the process, policies and politics that generated the underlying data in the first place.

### 3. Stuff on a map

Maps are very popular tools of choice for visualising information, but are frequently over- and mis- used. If you are not trying to make a specific point about geographic distribution, use a map. If there is a more important angle on your data which it is important to expose - perhaps consider another mechanism of displaying your information. 

Ask yourself, "what value does a map give?" A list, chart, or just plain text might be much more useful for your readers.
