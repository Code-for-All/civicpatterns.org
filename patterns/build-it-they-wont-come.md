## Common pitfalls: 

### 1. Building a destination

People want to solve a problem and go elsewhere. Don't expect people to to live in your site.

## 2. Believing they'll find it via Google 

Nope. They won't. 

## 3. Believing they'll visit it all the time

Apps on my home screen: Google, Facebook, the New York Times. Apps that will never be on my home screen: yours.

## 4. Believing / hoping "And then they will tell their friends!"

Nope. They wonâ€™t do that either, especially if "they" never came in the first place.
