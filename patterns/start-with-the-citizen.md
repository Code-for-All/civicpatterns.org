Do proper [user-centred design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) for your service. Think about real people, not some hypothetical 'average' (aka non-existent) user. 

## Where to go to find people (from Code for America)

Engage with people in the places they already go online: Facebook (FACEBOOK!), community blogs/forums or existing services (Foursquare, Twitter, etc.) rather than trying to get them to transfer their activities to your new platform. This could include: Facebook or blog widgets; bookmarklets or browser extensions; embeddable content; or messaging services (Twitter, instant messenger, etc.). This can work hand in hand with the It Alerts You pattern.
