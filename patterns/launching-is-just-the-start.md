When you first launch your product, it sometimes feels like all the work is done and you can
sit back and relax. However, getting your product out the door is only the start.
It's the first time your users will get to use what you've built,
this is when it gets exciting. Celebrate the launch, embrace it as the start of your
journey.

After launching you need to start finding customers and watching how they use your product.
What needs to be improved? What's missing? What's just plain wrong? How does your product
need to change and evolve?

Keep this in mind when determining your development costs. Your development budget needs
to go well beyond your first release.
