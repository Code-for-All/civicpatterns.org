Start with your user. Who are they and what problems do they have? What would a
good solution mean for them? What might that solution look like?

Don't get distracted by what you're *able* to build, focus on what you *should*
build. By focusing on what your user needs -- and not what your team wants to
build -- you're more likely to solve a real world problem and not be boxed in
by old, outdated ideas and tools.
