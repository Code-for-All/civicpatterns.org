title: Little Zen of Civic Tech Re-Use
layout: default
---

* Don't build for the mythical average citizen.
* Tech can change an environment, not make one.
* Commodity civic tools only work in commodity countries.
* Local optimisation must reduce friction in re-use.
* Re-use components, not end products.
    * Separate the mechanism and the project.
* Re-use is not a goal, it's a means.
* Standards are things that work, not books.
* Be aware of the lifespan of a project.
* Our review mechanisms are broken, as is the way we get cash.
